# Time-series-aanalysis-and-forecasting-for-stock-market
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock market trends using time series analysis techniques. The stock market is inherently dynamic, with complex patterns influenced by both historical data and external factors.

Interns will:

Study historical stock price data to identify key patterns.

Apply time series models (statistical and machine learning-based) to forecast future values.

Compare model performance to understand strengths and limitations.

Interpret results to generate actionable financial insights.


The project provides hands-on exposure to financial analytics, data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and evaluation metrics, simulating real-world challenges in quantitative finance.

Objectives

1. Learn the fundamentals of time series analysis (trend, seasonality, stationarity).


2. Preprocess and visualize stock price data for exploratory analysis.


3. Implement and compare forecasting models such as:

Statistical Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBoost

Deep Learning Models: LSTM, GRU, Transformer-based models


4. Evaluate models using forecast accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE).


5. Provide short-term and long-term predictions with confidence intervals.
